## Globessey Data Server

Globessey Data Server (GDS) allows storing, transmitting, and querying large amounts of data, all through different levels of authority that are adjustable in detail. The GDS can manage meta data and the associated attachments. It is a scalable, high availability system that natively supports load balancing.
