## Globessey Data Server

Globessey Data Server (GDS) allows storing, transmitting, and querying large amounts of data, all through different levels of authority that are adjustable in detail. The GDS can manage meta data and the associated attachments. It is a scalable, high availability system that natively supports load balancing.

### Getting Started

If you want to use the system as a user, you can use its features by sending messages which are embedded into [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) packages (they are also on [GitHub](https://github.com/msgpack)). We provide [[SDK]] in some languages, so you may not need to implement it from scratch. If you want to implement it at a low level, you can also find the [[Specification]].

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/arh-eu/gds/wiki) for guides.
